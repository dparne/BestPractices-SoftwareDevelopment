Notes as to what to do for an Ideal Project Development

# Estimation
- Always try to account for time to Document and Test things.. based on the requirements. It is always good to have some documentation even if it isn't talked about. (Always try to document things which a new developer might not able to get right away without experiencing the same hurdles you might be going through.)
- Always have a proper release cycle planned.
- Setup multiple environments of development (example:  Dev, Test, Prod at the very minimum)

# Planning ahead
- Plan for people being out. If someone is out, account for that time in planning and estimation.
- Find out if anyone you are depending on for KT or something else is out. So that you can plan for what to work on those days without getting blocked.
- Every developer should maintain an On boarding document.

### Team Structure to plan for.
- Devs ofcourse. (Ideally unit tests)
- Automation for identifying errors which may have been missed during code review.
- Continuous Intergration and Continous Delivery
- Think about Performance testing. Scaling opportunities
- Integrate measurement tools into your release process
- KPI measurement
